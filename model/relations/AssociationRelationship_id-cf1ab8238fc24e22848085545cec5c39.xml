    documentation="When procuring services, especially for critical ones, the company is well advised to consciously design collaboration. This gives the company the indirect opportunity to exert a positive influence on the quality of the interplay and the results arising from it. In contrast to the Cooperation Value, the customer-supplier relationship has been clarified here. But this approach can be shaped again in two ways: Do I see the service providers as economically dependent slaves, or as experts on an equal footing, who help the company to eliminate problems? If you lose sight of this aspect, it is possible that the company will not find suitable suppliers at some point in the future.">
