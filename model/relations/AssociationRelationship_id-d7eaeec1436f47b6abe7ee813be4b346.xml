    documentation="As the name suggests, this is about the value added by sales for an organization. What is the quality of the relationship with the prospective customer? Is the sale made by a column of pushers, or is there appropriate advice that leaves a happy customer behind, who will recommend? What promises are made that have to be kept afterwards at the customer?">
