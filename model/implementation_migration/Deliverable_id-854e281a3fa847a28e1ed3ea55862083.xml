    documentation="SBB identified&#xA;Risks listed&#xA;&#xA;Purpose&#xA;&#xA;The Architecture Roadmap lists individual work packages that will realize the Target Architecture and lays them out on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. The Architecture Roadmap highlights individual work packages' business value at each stage. Transition Architectures necessary to effectively realize the Target Architecture are identified as intermediate steps. The Architecture Roadmap is incrementally developed throughout Phases E and F, and informed by readily identifiable roadmap components from Phase B, C, and D within the ADM.&#xA;Content&#xA;&#xA;Typical contents of an Architecture Roadmap are:&#xA;&#xA;    Work package portfolio:&#xA;        Work package description (name, description, objectives, deliverables)&#xA;        Functional requirements&#xA;        Dependencies&#xA;        Relationship to opportunity&#xA;        Relationship to Architecture Definition Document and Architecture Requirements Specification&#xA;        Business value&#xA;    Implementation Factor catalog, including:&#xA;        Risks&#xA;        Issues&#xA;        Assumptions&#xA;        Dependencies&#xA;        Actions&#xA;        Inputs&#xA;    Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix, including:&#xA;        Architecture domain&#xA;        Gap&#xA;        Potential solutions&#xA;        Dependencies&#xA;    Any Transition Architectures&#xA;    Implementation recommendations:&#xA;        Criteria measures of effectiveness of projects&#xA;        Risks and issues&#xA;        Solution Building Blocks&#xA;"/>
